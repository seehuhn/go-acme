- Let's encrypt recomments to renew certificates when they have a third of
  their total lifetime left.
  https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/
- increase the timeout value to avoid the following error:
    root@seehuhn:~/acme# ~voss/servercert -D=false renew -f imap.seehuhn.de
    renewing imap.seehuhn.de
    context deadline exceeded

- keep track of how much of the rate limit allowance we have used
- in AcceptTOS, keep track of which terms have been agreed to

- Find a way to report to the caller which certificates need to be
  reloaded.
- make sure we won't accumulate pending authorizations
- in the "check-cert" command, say when a certificate is self-signed
- add documentation

- don't abort renewals, when individual sites fail?
- keep a log of events, including all the rate limited ones
- add more unit tests
- consider https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html
- allow to restrict "check" to individual domains?
- keep a backup of replaced but still valid certificates?
- add revocations
