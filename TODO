- decide whether the command name is "check-cert" or "check-certs"
- keep track of how much of the rate limit allowance we have used
- don't abort renewals, when individual sites fail
- Find a way to report to the caller which certificates need to be
  reloaded.
- use a deterministic order for the output of "servercert check-certs"
- use a deterministic order for the commands in "servercert --help"
- add documentation

- in AcceptTOS, keep track of which terms have been agreed to
- keep a log of events, including all the rate limited ones
- add more unit tests
- consider https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html
- change AccountDir to AccountKey???
- allow to restrict "check" to individual domains?
- in the "check-cert" command, say when a certificate is self-signed
- implement a "backup" command?
